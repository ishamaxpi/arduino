# What is Arduino???

Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on hardware (single-board microcontroller) and software (arduino software-**I**ntegrated **D**evelopement **E**nvironment aka **IDE**).  

Generally, arduino-boards are Atmel 8-bit AVR microcontroller based (some like____ are microprocessor based). Arduino-boards have facillity of **analog and digital I/O pins** making it able to interact with the physical world. This is acheived by sending instruction to arduino-boards. This is done with Arduino programming language (typically like C nad C++) and Ardino software (**IDE**).

## why to choose Arduino??

1.) Inexpensive  
2.) Cross-platform  
3.) Simple, clear programming environment  
4.) Open source and extensible software  
5.) Open source and extensible hardware  

There are many Arduino-boards designed for different purposes.  

There are many appliactions you can use with Arduino.   

## Arduino and LED

### 1 Hands-on Arduino and LED- LED Blinking

</p>

#### Code

```
// the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board  

void setup()  
{  
  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);     // initialize digital pin LED_BUILTIN as an output.  
}  

// the loop function runs over and over again forever  

void loop()  
{  
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);   // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)  
  delay(1000);                       // wait for a second  
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);    // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW  
  delay(1000);                       // wait for a second  
}  

```

## Arduino and LDR

### Hands-on Ardino and LDR- with servo motor

#### Hardware Required

**1.)** Arduino  
**2.)** Servo motor  
**3.)** 2 LDR  
**4.)** Wires  

#### Circuit Diagram

#### Code

```
#include <Servo.h>           //including the library of servo motor   
Servo sg90;                  //initializing a variable for servo named sg90  
int initial_position = 90;   //Declaring the initial position at 90  
int LDR1 = A0;               //Pin at which LDR is connected  
int LDR2 = A1;               //Pin at which LDR is connected  
int error = 5;               //initializing variable for error  
int servopin=9;  

void setup()  
{   
  sg90.attach(servopin);     // attaches the servo on pin 9  
  pinMode(LDR1, INPUT);      //Making the LDR pin as input  
  pinMode(LDR2, INPUT);
  sg90.write(initial_position);   //Move servo at 90 degree  
  delay(2000);               // giving a delay of 2 seconds  
}  
 
void loop()  
{  
  int R1 = analogRead(LDR1);  // reading value from LDR 1  
  int R2 = analogRead(LDR2);  // reading value from LDR 2  
  int diff1= abs(R1 - R2);    // Calculating the difference between the LDR's  
  int diff2= abs(R2 - R1);  
  
  if((diff1 <= error) || (diff2 <= error))  
  {  
    //if the difference is under the error then do nothing
  } 
  else  
  {    
    if(R1 > R2)  
    {  
      initial_position = --initial_position;  //Move the servo towards 0 degree  
    }  
    if(R1 < R2)  
    {
      initial_position = ++initial_position;  //Move the servo towards 180 degree  
    }  
  }  
  sg90.write(initial_position);               // write the position to servo  
  delay(100);  
}
